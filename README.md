# ytpt - YouTube Processing Tool

**ytpt** (YouTube Processing Tool) is a simple tool for downloading YouTube videos and transcribing them using faster-whisper on your local hardware. The goal is to generate text transcripts that can be used with large language models for notetaking, analysis, or other purposes.

## Overview

This tool does two main things:
- Downloads videos from YouTube
- Transcribes the audio using faster-whisper locally

Processing everything locally means you don't need to send your audio to external services, and you can take advantage of your own hardware (including GPU acceleration if available). The transcripts can then be used however you need them - fed into LLMs, saved for notes, or processed further.

## Features

- Download YouTube videos
- Transcribe audio using faster-whisper
